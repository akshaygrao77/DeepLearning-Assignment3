# DeepLearning-Assignment3
# Part A instructions  
**Enable GPU run Environment for faster runs**
# Output Execution using command lines and CMD (download from google colab part_a.py)
**you can execute either of them for outputs**
## Entire assignment was done using google colab. However we provide options for CMD arguments as well (but to be executed using .py files in cmd prompt)
### The following are instructions to execute code using command line  
**download part_a.py and mount the path where file is downloaded**<br />
## Install required pakages like keras,Tensorflow etc and  execute below three command lines **<br />
**pip install wandb**<br />
**wandb login**<br />
**pip install wget**<br />
**python part_a.py -h**<br />
**below is the usage of diiferent cmd commands to get the respective outputs**<br />
```
usage: ipykernel_launcher.py [-h] [-pgb] [-visfilters] [-cgbm] [-runbest]
                             {run_model} ...
positional arguments are provided in the colab note book execute them seperately
```
# output Execution using google colab (Assignment_3_partA_without attention.ipynb )
  # Run all cells in Assignment_3_partA_without attention.ipynb to get outputs(until last before two cells output) and ignore last two cells (cmd args)
  **we will  get all results of Q1 to Q4 (for creative outputs vibgyaor a seperate code is written in Question_4_creative_outputs.ipynb
 # output Execution using google colab (Assignment_3_partB_with attention.ipynb )
  # Run all cells in Assignment_3_partA_without attention.ipynb to get outputs(until last before two cells output) and ignore last two cells (cmd args)
  **we will  get all results of Q5 to Q6 (Q6 code connectivity code is written in seperate block with proper headers execute it after getting the trained RNN_model)
  seperate functions written for heatmaps
  # Q_8 output Execution using google colab (GPT2_finetune.ipynb )
  # GPT2_finetune.ipynb is code for 8th question --- execute it and see the output also commented more in the report
